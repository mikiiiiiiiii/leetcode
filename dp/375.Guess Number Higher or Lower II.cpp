//The best strategy to play the game is to minimize the maximum loss you could
//possibly face. Another strategy is to minimize the expected loss. Here, we are
// interested in the first scenario.
//Take a small example (n = 3). What do you end up paying in the worst case?
//Check out this article if you're still stuck.
//The purely recursive implementation of minimax would be worthless for even a
//small n. You MUST use dynamic programming.
//As a follow-up, how would you modify your code to solve the problem of
//minimizing the expected loss, instead of the worst-case loss?

//MINMAX算法？？
//DP???
